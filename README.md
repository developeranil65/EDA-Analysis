# EDA-Analysis
EDA-Analysis on Household power consumption Dataset

📊 Project Overview
This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset related to household power consumption. The primary aim of this analysis is to clean, manipulate, and visualize energy consumption patterns over time using Python and standard data science libraries.

✅ Completed as part of the Data Science Minor Program under the guidance of Maneet Kaur Ma’am.

📁 Dataset
Source: [Household Power Consumption Dataset]

Contains multiple attributes like:
Date
Time
Global_active_power
Global_reactive_power
Voltage
